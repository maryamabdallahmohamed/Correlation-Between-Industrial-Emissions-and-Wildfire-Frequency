# Correlation Between Industrial Emissions and Wildfire Frequency

This project explores the relationship between industrial emissions and wildfire frequency to determine whether human industrial activity contributes to increased wildfire risk. By integrating datasets on greenhouse gas emissions, wildfire occurrences, climate conditions, land use, and human activity, the study aims to identify key correlations and potential causal links.

## Data Sources

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset** and **EDGAR Database**:  
  Detail COâ‚‚, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions by sector and region.
  
- **NASA Global Fire Data** and **Global Forest Watch**:  
  Provide information on fire locations, intensity, and deforestation-related fires.

- **Climate Variables** (from NOAA and World Bank):  
  Include temperature and drought indices to assess environmental conditions.

## Methodology

- **Statistical Techniques**:  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Regression modeling  
  - Geospatial visualization

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  Used to predict wildfire risks based on emissions levels.

- **Causation Analysis**:  
  - Granger causality test to determine if emissions trends precede wildfire activity.

## Impact and Applications

The findings will provide valuable insights for:

- **Policymakers and Environmental Agencies**:  
  To identify industrial sectors and pollutants that may contribute to wildfire risks.

- **Researchers**:  
  Supporting the development of targeted regulations and mitigation strategies.

This study aims to reduce the impact of industrial emissions on fire-prone regions and promote sustainable environmental policies.
