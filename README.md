# Correlation Between Industrial Emissions and Wildfire Frequency
This project explores the relationship between industrial emissions and wildfire frequency to determine whether human industrial activity contributes to increased wildfire risk. By integrating datasets on greenhouse gas emissions, wildfire occurrences, climate conditions, land use, and human activity, the study aims to identify key correlations and potential causal links.

The research will analyze emissions data from the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset and EDGAR Database, which detail COâ‚‚, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions by sector and region. Wildfire data from NASA Global Fire Data and Global Forest Watch will provide information on fire locations, intensity, and deforestation-related fires. Additional climate variables, such as temperature and drought indices from NOAA and World Bank, will be used to assess environmental conditions that mediate this relationship.

Using statistical correlation analysis, regression modeling, and geospatial visualization techniques, the study will examine how emissions, land use patterns, and climate conditions influence wildfire occurrences. Advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, will be employed to predict wildfire risks based on emissions levels. Further, causation tests, including the Granger causality test, will be conducted to determine whether emissions trends precede wildfire activity.

The findings will provide valuable insights for policymakers, environmental agencies, and researchers by identifying industrial sectors and pollutants that may contribute to wildfire risks. This study will support the development of targeted regulations and mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of industrial emissions on fire-prone regions and promote sustainable environmental policies.
