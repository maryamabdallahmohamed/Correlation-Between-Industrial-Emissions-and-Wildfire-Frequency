# Correlation-Between-Industrial-Emissions-and-Wildfire-Frequency
This project analyzes the correlation between industrial emissions and wildfire frequency using emissions, wildfire, climate, and land use data. Statistical and machine learning models will identify key risk factors and potential causal links. Findings will help policymakers develop mitigation strategies to reduce wildfire risks .
